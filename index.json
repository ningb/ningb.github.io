They have shown great translational promise as either diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets. While the similarities between transcriptomic profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia have been thoroughly studied before, less is known on the microRNA side. This project aims to provide critical biological knowledge on the extent of consensus microRNA expression and regulation between cell line models and primary human tumors.\nMethod: First, we examined the similarity of miRNA expression profiles between CCLE cell lines and TCGA tumor samples for each cancer type. Next, we compared the expression of miRNAs associating the hallmarks of cancer pathways. Finally, we constructed miRNA-mRNA regulatory network for each cancer type and evaluated whether the regulatory role of each miRNA is conserved between cell lines and tumor samples.\nResults: Our results indicate that, similar to gene expression, how well cancer cell line microRNA expression would capture the transcriptomic profile of human cancer tissues is greatly affected by the tumor type and purity. The cell-type composition for a cancer type also affects how accurately cancer cell lines could reflect the miRNA expression in tumor tissues. Furthermore, through network analysis, we show that certain microRNAs, not all, regulate the same set of target genes in both the cell line and human cancer tissues.\nConclusions: Through systematically comparing the miRNA expression profile and the regulatory network, our study highlights the biological differences between cell line and tumor samples and provides resources for future miRNA and cancer studies.","tags":null,"title":"Regulatory landscapes of specific miRNAs are conserved between cell lines and primary tumors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Berthet JH, Ning B, ..., Lenburg ME, Beane JE, Monti S and Veralas X"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625097600,"objectID":"7da10b14f2184d8b961d9eba6923eefb","permalink":"https://ningb.github.io/publication/gorskim_kidint_2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gorskim_kidint_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Proper lung function relies on the precise balance of specialized epithelial cells that coordinate to maintain homeostasis.

However, most current methods for detecting rewiring events (differential network connectivity) are not optimized for miRNA-mediated gene regulation and fail to systematically examine predicted target genes in study designs with multiple groups. We developed a novel method to address the current challenges. The Differential Regulation Analysis for miRNAs (DReAmiR) method first estimates miRNA-gene expression correlations with Spatial Quantile Normalization to remove the mean-correlation relationship. Then, for each miRNA, genes are ranked by their correlation strength per group. Enrichment patterns of predicted target genes are compared using the Anderson-Darling test and significance levels are estimated via permutation. Finally, graph embedding or difference in enrichment score maximization is performed to prioritize group-specific target genes.\nThe R package DReAmiR can be installed from here.\n","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"4379f19f3403e1462445c8165d42b5a1","permalink":"https://ningb.github.io/software/dreamir/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/dreamir/","section":"software","summary":"Novel method and R package for conducting differential regulation analysis for miRNAs.","tags":null,"title":"DReAmiR","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you‚Äôll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head()  Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === \u0026#39;undefined\u0026#39; ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\u0026#34;./line-chart.json\u0026#34;, function(chart) { Plotly.plot(\u0026#39;chart-458697312\u0026#39;, chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  You might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams.

Dpb11 binds to S-phase cyclin-dependent kinase-phosphorylated Sld2 and Sld3 to form a ternary complex during S phase. The replication fork helicase in eukaryotes is composed of Cdc45, Mcm2-7, and GINS. We show here, using purified proteins from budding yeast, that Dpb11 alone binds to Mcm2-7 and that Dpb11 also competes with GINS for binding to Mcm2-7. Furthermore, Dpb11 binds directly to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and ssDNA inhibits the Dpb11 interaction with Mcm2-7. We also found that Dpb11 can recruit Cdc45 to Mcm2-7. We identified a mutant of the BRCT4 motif of Dpb11 that remains bound to Mcm2-7 in the presence of ssDNA (dpb11-m1,m2,m3,m5), and this mutant exhibits a DNA replication defect when expressed in budding yeast cells. Expression of this mutant results in increased interaction between Dpb11 and Mcm2-7 during S phase, impaired GINS interaction with Mcm2-7 during S phase, and decreased replication protein A (RPA) interaction with origin DNA during S phase. We propose a model in which Dpb11 first recruits Cdc45 to Mcm2-7. Dpb11, although bound to Cdc45¬∑Mcm2-7, can block the interaction between GINS and Mcm2-7. Upon extrusion of ssDNA from the central channel of Mcm2-7, Dpb11 dissociates from Mcm2-7, and Dpb11 binds to ssDNA, thereby allowing GINS to bind to Cdc45¬∑Mcm2-7. Finally, we propose that Dpb11 functions with Sld2 and Sld3 to help control the assembly of the replication fork helicase.","tags":null,"title":"Dpb11 Protein Helps Control Assembly of the Cdc45¬∑Mcm2-7¬∑GINS Replication Fork Helicase","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://ningb.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
