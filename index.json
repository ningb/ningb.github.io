They have shown great translational promise as either diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets. While the similarities between transcriptomic profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia have been thoroughly studied before, less is known on the microRNA side. This project aims to provide critical biological knowledge on the extent of consensus microRNA expression and regulation between cell line models and primary human tumors.\nMethod: First, we examined the similarity of miRNA expression profiles between CCLE cell lines and TCGA tumor samples for each cancer type. Next, we compared the expression of miRNAs associating the hallmarks of cancer pathways. Finally, we constructed miRNA-mRNA regulatory network for each cancer type and evaluated whether the regulatory role of each miRNA is conserved between cell lines and tumor samples.\nResults: Our results indicate that, similar to gene expression, how well cancer cell line microRNA expression would capture the transcriptomic profile of human cancer tissues is greatly affected by the tumor type and purity. The cell-type composition for a cancer type also affects how accurately cancer cell lines could reflect the miRNA expression in tumor tissues. Furthermore, through network analysis, we show that certain microRNAs, not all, regulate the same set of target genes in both the cell line and human cancer tissues.\nConclusions: Through systematically comparing the miRNA expression profile and the regulatory network, our study highlights the biological differences between cell line and tumor samples and provides resources for future miRNA and cancer studies.","tags":null,"title":"Regulatory landscapes of specific miRNAs are conserved between cell lines and primary tumors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Berthet JH, Ning B, ..., Lenburg ME, Beane JE, Monti S and Veralas X"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1625097600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625097600,"objectID":"ec62d2005d51acece3161ee32f30b60f","permalink":"https://ningb.github.io/publication/hicksberthet_cellrep_2021/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hicksberthet_cellrep_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Proper lung function relies on the precise balance of specialized epithelial cells that coordinate to maintain homeostasis. Herein, we describe essential roles for the transcriptional regulators YAP/TAZ in maintaining lung epithelial homeostasis, reporting that conditional deletion of Yap and Wwtr1/Taz in the lung epithelium of adult mice results in severe defects, including alveolar disorganization and the development of airway mucin hypersecretion. Through in vivo lineage tracing and in vitro molecular experiments, we reveal that reduced YAP/TAZ activity promotes intrinsic goblet transdifferentiation of secretory airway epithelial cells. Global gene expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses suggest that YAP/TAZ act cooperatively with TEA domain (TEAD) transcription factors and the NuRD complex to suppress the goblet cell fate program, directly repressing the SPDEF gene. Collectively, our study identifies YAP/TAZ as critical factors in lung epithelial homeostasis and offers molecular insight into the mechanisms promoting goblet cell differentiation, which is a hallmark of many lung diseases.","tags":null,"title":"Yap/Taz inhibit goblet cell fate to maintain lung epithelial homeostasis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gorski M, Jung B, [et al, including Ning B]"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"7da10b14f2184d8b961d9eba6923eefb","permalink":"https://ningb.github.io/publication/gorskim_kidint_2021/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gorskim_kidint_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Rapid decline of glomerular filtration rate estimated from creatinine (eGFRcrea) is associated with severe clinical endpoints. In contrast to cross-sectionally assessed eGFRcrea, the genetic basis for rapid eGFRcrea decline is largely unknown. To help define this, we meta-analyzed 42 genome-wide association studies from the Chronic Kidney Diseases Genetics Consortium and United Kingdom Biobank to identify genetic loci for rapid eGFRcrea decline. Two definitions of eGFRcrea decline were used: 3 mL/min/1.73m2/year or more (“Rapid3”; encompassing 34,874 cases, 107,090 controls) and eGFRcrea decline 25% or more and eGFRcrea under 60 mL/min/1.73m2 at follow-up among those with eGFRcrea 60 mL/min/1.73m2 or more at baseline (“CKDi25”; encompassing 19,901 cases, 175,244 controls). Seven independent variants were identified across six loci for Rapid3 and/or CKDi25: consisting of five variants at four loci with genome-wide significance (near UMOD-PDILT (2), PRKAG2, WDR72, OR2S2) and two variants among 265 known eGFRcrea variants (near GATM, LARP4B). All these loci were novel for Rapid3 and/or CKDi25 and our bioinformatic follow-up prioritized variants and genes underneath these loci. The OR2S2 locus is novel for any eGFRcrea trait including interesting candidates. For the five genome-wide significant lead variants, we found supporting effects for annual change in blood urea nitrogen or cystatin-based eGFR, but not for GATM or LARP4B. Individuals at high compared to those at low genetic risk (8-14 vs. 0-5 adverse alleles) had a 1.20-fold increased risk of acute kidney injury (95% confidence interval 1.08-1.33). Thus, our identified loci for rapid kidney function decline may help prioritize therapeutic targets and identify mechanisms and individuals at risk for sustained deterioration of kidney function.","tags":null,"title":"Meta-analysis uncovers genome-wide significant variants for rapid kidney function decline","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xu K, Shi X, Husted C, Hong R, Wang Y, Ning B, ..., Beane JE"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"7d59be72f34d2b390f174bf1fad799e3","permalink":"https://ningb.github.io/publication/xuk_medrxiv_2021/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/xuk_medrxiv_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2), which infects host cells with help from the Viral Entry (VE) proteins ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL1–4. Proposed risk factors for viral infection, as well as the rate of disease progression, include age5,6, sex7, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease7,8, cancer9, and cigarette smoking10–13. To investigate whether the proposed risk factors increase viral infection by modulation of the VE genes, we examined gene expression profiles of 796 nasal and 1,673 bronchial samples across four lung cancer screening cohorts containing individuals without COVID-19. Smoking was the only clinical factor reproducibly associated with the expression of any VE gene across cohorts. ACE2 expression was significantly up-regulated with smoking in the bronchus but significantly down-regulated with smoking in the nose. Furthermore, expression of individual VE genes were not correlated between paired nasal and bronchial samples from the same patients. Single-cell RNA-seq of nasal brushings revealed that an ACE2 gene module was detected in a variety of nasal secretory cells with the highest expression in the C15orf48+ secretory cells, while a TMPRSS2 gene module was most highly expressed in nasal keratinizing epithelial cells. In contrast, single-cell RNA-seq of bronchial brushings revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene modules were most enriched in MUC5AC+ bronchial goblet cells. The CTSL gene module was highly expressed in immune populations of both nasal and bronchial brushings. Deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq showed that the proportion of MUC5AC+ goblet cells was increased in current smokers in both the nose and bronchus but proportions of nasal keratinizing epithelial cells, C15orf48+ secretory cells, and immune cells were not associated with smoking status. The complex association between VE gene expression and smoking in the nasal and bronchial epithelium revealed by our results may partially explain conflicting reports on the association between smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection.","tags":null,"title":"Smoking modulates different secretory subpopulations expressing SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in the nasal and bronchial airways","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Boting Ning","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

However, most current methods for detecting rewiring events (differential network connectivity) are not optimized for miRNA-mediated gene regulation and fail to systematically examine predicted target genes in study designs with multiple groups. We developed a novel method to address the current challenges. The Differential Regulation Analysis for miRNAs (DReAmiR) method first estimates miRNA-gene expression correlations with Spatial Quantile Normalization to remove the mean-correlation relationship. Then, for each miRNA, genes are ranked by their correlation strength per group. Enrichment patterns of predicted target genes are compared using the Anderson-Darling test and significance levels are estimated via permutation. Finally, graph embedding or difference in enrichment score maximization is performed to prioritize group-specific target genes.\nThe R package DReAmiR can be installed from here.\n","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598918400,"objectID":"4379f19f3403e1462445c8165d42b5a1","permalink":"https://ningb.github.io/software/dreamir/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/software/dreamir/","section":"software","summary":"Novel method and R package for conducting differential regulation analysis for miRNAs.","tags":null,"title":"DReAmiR","type":"page"},{"authors":["Teumer A, Li Y, [et al, including Ning B]"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"05871674f83cc7f042a1a4129a4d7e76","permalink":"https://ningb.github.io/publication/teumera_natcomm_2019/","publishdate":"2019-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/teumera_natcomm_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Increased levels of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) are associated with higher risk of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events, but underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood.

Genetic correlation analyses and risk score associations in an independent electronic medical records database (n = 192,868) reveal connections with proteinuria, hyperlipidemia, gout, and hypertension. Fine-mapping and trans-Omics analyses with gene expression in 47 tissues and plasma protein levels implicate genes potentially operating through differential expression in kidney (including TGFB1, MUC1, PRKCI, and OAF), and allow coupling of UACR associations to altered plasma OAF concentrations.

We performed a trans-ancestry genome-wide association study of serum urate in 457,690 individuals, identifying 183 loci (147 previously unknown) that improve the prediction of gout in an independent cohort of 334,880 individuals. Serum urate showed significant genetic correlations with many cardiometabolic traits, with genetic causality analyses supporting a substantial role for pleiotropy. Enrichment analysis, fine-mapping of urate-associated loci and colocalization with gene expression in 47 tissues implicated the kidney and liver as the main target organs and prioritized potentially causal genes and variants, including the transcriptional master regulators in the liver and kidney, HNF1A and HNF4A. Experimental validation showed that HNF4A transactivated the promoter of ABCG2, encoding a major urate transporter, in kidney cells, and that HNF4A p.Thr139Ile is a functional variant. Transcriptional coregulation within and across organs may be a general mechanism underlying the observed pleiotropy between urate and cardiometabolic traits.","tags":null,"title":"Target genes, variants, tissues and transcriptional pathways influencing human serum urate levels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wuttke M, Li Y, [et al, including Ning B]"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"0ed42ce6750f4443b76cd78e9fa4f71f","permalink":"https://ningb.github.io/publication/wuttkem_natgen_2019/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wuttkem_natgen_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is responsible for a public health burden with multi-systemic complications. Through trans-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and independent replication (n = 1,046,070), we identified 264 associated loci (166 new). Of these, 147 were likely to be relevant for kidney function on the basis of associations with the alternative kidney function marker blood urea nitrogen (n = 416,178). Pathway and enrichment analyses, including mouse models with renal phenotypes, support the kidney as the main target organ. A genetic risk score for lower eGFR was associated with clinically diagnosed CKD in 452,264 independent individuals. Colocalization analyses of associations with eGFR among 783,978 European-ancestry individuals and gene expression across 46 human tissues, including tubulo-interstitial and glomerular kidney compartments, identified 17 genes differentially expressed in kidney. Fine-mapping highlighted missense driver variants in 11 genes and kidney-specific regulatory variants. These results provide a comprehensive priority list of molecular targets for translational research.","tags":null,"title":"A catalog of genetic loci associated with kidney function from analyses of a million individuals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Boting Ning"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;)     print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;)  Welcome to Academic!

Objective:Parameters obtained from the dCDT were used to investigate neurocognitive constructs related to higher-order neurocognitive decision making and information processing speed. The current research sought to determine the effect of age as related to combined motor and non-motor components of drawing, and higher-order decision making latencies. Methods:A large group of stroke- and dementia- free Framingham Heart Study participants were administered the dCDT to command and copy with hands set for “10 after 11”. Six age groups (age range 28–98) were constructed. Results:Differences between age groups were found for total time to completion, total pen stroke count, and higher-order decision making latencies in both command and copy test conditions. Conclusion:Longer age-related decision making latencies may reflect a greater need for working memory and increased self-monitoring in older subjects. These latency measures have potential to serve as neurocognitive biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease and other insidious neurodegenerative disorders.","tags":null,"title":"Age and graphomotor decision making assessed with the digital clock drawing test: the Framingham Heart Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dhingra N, Bruck I, Smith S, Ning B and Kaplan DL"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1425168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1425168000,"objectID":"7b829a88900313c8e48121dc5719d6b2","permalink":"https://ningb.github.io/publication/dhingran_jbc_2015/","publishdate":"2015-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dhingran_jbc_2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Dpb11 is required for the initiation of DNA replication in budding yeast. Dpb11 binds to S-phase cyclin-dependent kinase-phosphorylated Sld2 and Sld3 to form a ternary complex during S phase. The replication fork helicase in eukaryotes is composed of Cdc45, Mcm2-7, and GINS. We show here, using purified proteins from budding yeast, that Dpb11 alone binds to Mcm2-7 and that Dpb11 also competes with GINS for binding to Mcm2-7. Furthermore, Dpb11 binds directly to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and ssDNA inhibits the Dpb11 interaction with Mcm2-7. We also found that Dpb11 can recruit Cdc45 to Mcm2-7. We identified a mutant of the BRCT4 motif of Dpb11 that remains bound to Mcm2-7 in the presence of ssDNA (dpb11-m1,m2,m3,m5), and this mutant exhibits a DNA replication defect when expressed in budding yeast cells. Expression of this mutant results in increased interaction between Dpb11 and Mcm2-7 during S phase, impaired GINS interaction with Mcm2-7 during S phase, and decreased replication protein A (RPA) interaction with origin DNA during S phase. We propose a model in which Dpb11 first recruits Cdc45 to Mcm2-7. Dpb11, although bound to Cdc45·Mcm2-7, can block the interaction between GINS and Mcm2-7. Upon extrusion of ssDNA from the central channel of Mcm2-7, Dpb11 dissociates from Mcm2-7, and Dpb11 binds to ssDNA, thereby allowing GINS to bind to Cdc45·Mcm2-7. Finally, we propose that Dpb11 functions with Sld2 and Sld3 to help control the assembly of the replication fork helicase.","tags":null,"title":"Dpb11 Protein Helps Control Assembly of the Cdc45·Mcm2-7·GINS Replication Fork Helicase","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ning B, Feldkamp MD, Cortez D, Chazin WJ, Friedman KL and Fanning E"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1422748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1422748800,"objectID":"e56eae50c58b12210e6a4799c3b3f378","permalink":"https://ningb.github.io/publication/ningb_plosone_2015/","publishdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ningb_plosone_2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Simian virus 40 (SV40) serves as an important model organism for studying eukaryotic DNA replication. Its helicase, Large T-antigen (Tag), is a multi-functional protein that interacts with multiple host proteins, including the ubiquitous ssDNA binding protein Replication Protein A (RPA). Tag recruits RPA, actively loads it onto the unwound DNA, and together they promote priming of the template. Although interactions of Tag with RPA have been mapped, no interaction between Tag and the N-terminal protein interaction domain of the RPA 70kDa subunit (RPA70N) has been reported. Here we provide evidence of direct physical interaction of Tag with RPA70N and map the binding sites using a series of pull-down and mutational experiments. In addition, a monoclonal anti-Tag antibody, the epitope of which overlaps with the binding site, blocks the binding of Tag to RPA70N. We use NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis to show that Tag uses the same basic cleft in RPA70N as multiple of DNA damage response proteins. Mutations in the binding sites of both RPA70N and Tag demonstrate that specific charge reversal substitutions in either binding partner strongly diminish the interaction. These results expand the known repertoire of contacts between Tag and RPA, which mediate the many critical roles of Tag in viral replication.","tags":null,"title":"Simian virus Large T antigen interacts with the N-terminal domain of the 70 kD subunit of Replication Protein A in the same mode as multiple DNA damage response factors","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://ningb.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
